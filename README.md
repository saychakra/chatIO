# chatIO
Simple chat app using nodejs, jquery, express and socket.io


The users can chat on the following link:
http://flannel-goose-70676.herokuapp.com/
(please remember not to use the 's' in http. Otherwise the program will not work)

The program is being hosted by heroku. As far as implementations are concerned it was implemented using nodejs, jquery, express and socket.io

As of now only the basic chat is implemented. Later on additional features can be introduced along with some asthetic modifications for a more pleasant look.
